# read flowmeter pulses

In this project, we read the pulses from an flowmeter in a given time. The water is catched by a bucket and the volume is read from scale.
The short times can be run through in several cycles so that you get a more accurate result on the scale.

The Code is written for a Arduino Mega2560 board.
